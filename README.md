# Golden Logo
A Krita plugin for using the golden ratio in logo design

## Installation
Download the repo and run
```
cd /path/to/folder
./install.sh
```
If you can't execute it, try it again after running
```
chmod +x install.sh
```
or maybe just sudo it
```
sudo ./install.sh
```

## To-do List
I eventually want to bring this tool to Adobe Illustrator and maybe GIMP. I have no idea when that'll happen.
